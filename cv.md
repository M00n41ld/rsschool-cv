### About me:

 When I was a teenager I always dreamed about working in a big IT company and making great things, luckily after graduating from Uni I started my career in one of those big companies, but as a sales manager, then i worked as HR, after that I became an Evangelist of the brand in another IT company, but I never thought about beeing an software engeneer, until one day, when I first tried HTML and CSS in one online editor. Surprisingly for myself, it was not that hard as I expected it to be, also it was really fascinating to see how buttons and elements are staring to appear on my screen, so... I decided to give coding a change to become my life's passion.
